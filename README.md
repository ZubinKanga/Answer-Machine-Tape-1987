# Answer-Machine-Tape-1987
Max patch for Answer Machine Tape 1987 created with Philip Venables and Simon Hendry 
This Max patch works with a Keyscanner attached to a full size piano â€“ it converts the resulting MIDI signals into text to be typed onto screen. 
There are controls for the layout of the text, the speed of the tickertape, as well as the cueing of the tape part.
